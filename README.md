A repository to store metadata files for managed cardano stake pools.

### Cardano Bitcoin Stake Pool (CBTC)
Our prediction is that one day there may be a tokenized version of Bitcoin running on the Cardano blockchain (cBTC). We have this now with Ethereum. Have you heard of wBTC? This is tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.

As the Cardano blockchain gains widespread popularity and economies of scale it
too will encompass Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies -- allowing cBTC to be
fully integrated into Cardano ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, staking and
lending services, prediction markets and other Cardano-enabled decentralized 
finance (DeFi) applications.

As stated, our prediction is that one day Bitcoin or a variant thereof will run on top of 
the Cardano blockchain. Join our stake pool (cBTC) to help further fully decentralize Cardano!
