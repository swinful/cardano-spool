### Cardano Bitcoin Stake Pool (CBTC)
My prediction is that one day there may be a tokenized version of Bitcoin running on the Cardano blockchain (cBTC). We have this now with Ethereum. Have you heard of wBTC? This is tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.

As the Cardano blockchain gains widespread popularity and economies of scale it
too will encompass Bitcoin and may other cryptocurrencies -- allowing cBTC to be
allowing BTC to be fully integrated into Cardano ecosystem of decentralized
exchanges, staking and lending services, prediction markets and other
Cardano-enabled decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.


Wishful thinking, but my prediction is that one day Bitcoin will run on top of the Cardano blockchain.
